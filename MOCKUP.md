The red alien lazer collides with the player ship which reduces his lives by 1.

After defeating all of the Aliens the player reached level 2 and the aliens were reset and their speed was increased.

GAME OVER screen:

The screen flashes game over before the program exits.

This mockup should be what it looks like in the final version with possiibly a few exceptions. For instance, occasionaly the bullet likes to freeze for no apparent reason, do not worry, it will still collide with the aliens and the score will adjust accordingly.
